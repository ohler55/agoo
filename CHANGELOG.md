- Added optimization description in `misc/optimize.md`.

- Fixed static file asset page caching bug.

## [2.2.1] - 2018-05-31

### Fixed
- Corrected header bug where a `:` in the value would cause an incorrect header key and value.
- Improved idle CPU use.

## [2.2.0] - 2018-05-30

### Added
- Clustering now supported with forked workers making Agoo even faster.

## [2.1.3] - 2018-05-16

### Added
- Optimized `rackup` to look for files in the root directory before calling rackup as the default. The root is now set to `./public` instead of `.`. The `:rmux` (rack multiplex) turns that off.

### Added
- Publish and subscribe to WebSocket and SSE connections now available. An example in the push subdirectory demonstrates how it works.

### Changed
- This is a minor release even though the API has changed. The changed API is the one for Rack based WebSocket and SSE connection upgrades. The PR for the spec addition is currently stalled but some suggestions for a stateless API are implemented in this release. The proposed Rack SPEC is [here](misc/SPEC). The PR is [here](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1272)

## [2.0.5] - 2018-05-06

### Changed
- Changed to putting all the path on the `REQUEST_PATH` variable instead of the `SCRIPT_NAME` to accomodate Rails which only uses the `REQUEST_PATH`.
- Duplicated all `HTTP_` variables to use an all upper case key in addition to the Rack spec simple concatenation to make Rails middleware work. There seems to be an undocumented agreement that all keys will be uppercase.
