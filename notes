- cluster
 - make some difference if nice is down on perfer (nice -n19)
  - use rack, slower ruby make bigger difference
 - update rails.md
  - add cluster
  - redo with faster machine
  - update README.md if numbers change

- remote cluster
 - worker server
  - connect, maybe with some kind of security
  - server feeds to worker
   - as packets arrive from con
    - needs to attach a connection id to each ppackets
    - worker reassemples
   - or create packet on server and pick a worker to sent it to
    - maybe based on how many outstanding to that worker and most recent latency
     - multiple and pick lowest
    - packet is con id + len + request

- action cable

 - implement spec using actioncable
  - middleware to grab env[upgrade] and then make the actioncable calls
  - maybe set up explicit channel for the connection
  
 - maybe we can expand to include pub-sub since ac uses it
