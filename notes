- server log hook
 - log callback grabs gvl
 
- remote cluster
 - worker server
  - connect, maybe with some kind of security
  - server feeds to worker
   - as packets arrive from con
    - needs to attach a connection id to each packet
    - worker reassemples
   - or create packet on server and pick a worker to sent it to
    - maybe based on how many outstanding to that worker and most recent latency
     - multiple and pick lowest
    - packet is con id + len + request
