[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ohler55/agoo/master.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/ohler55/agoo?branch=master)

A High Performance HTTP Server for Ruby

## Usage

```ruby
require 'agoo'

server = Agoo::Server.new(6464, 'root')

class MyHandler
  def initialize
  end

  def call(req)
    [ 200, { }, [ "hello world" ] ]
  end
end

handler = TellMeHandler.new
server.handle(:GET, "/hello", handler)
server.start()
```

## Installation
```
gem install agoo
```

## What Is This?

Agoo is Japanese for a type of flying fish. This gem flies. It is a high
performance HTTP server that serves static resource at hundreds of thousands
of fetchs per second. A a simple hello world Ruby handler at over 100,000
requests per second on a desktop computer. That places Agoo at about 80 times
faster than Sinatra and 1000 times faster than Rails. In both cases the
latency was an order of magnitude lower or more. Checkout the benchmarks on <a
href="http://opo.technology/benchmarks.html#web_benchmarks">OpO
benchmarks</a>. Note that the benchmarks had to use a C program called _hose_
from the <a href="http://opo.technology/index.html">OpO</a> downloads to hit
the Agoo limits. Ruby benchmarks driver could not push Agoo hard enough.

Agoo supports the [Ruby rack API](https://rack.github.io) which allows for the
use of rack compatible gems.
